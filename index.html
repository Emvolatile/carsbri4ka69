  <p>The Bugatti Chiron is a mid-engine two-seater sports car designed and developed in Germany by Bugatti Engineering GmbH and manufactured in Molsheim, France, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. The successor to the Bugatti Veyron, the Chiron was first shown at the Geneva Motor Show on 1 March 2016.The car is based on the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept car.</p>
<p>In January 2022, every Chiron had been sold. As of January 2022, some of these sold vehicles still need to be physically manufactured and delivered to their owners.</p>

<h2>McLaren P1</h2>

<p>The McLaren P1 is a limited-production mid-engine plug-in hybrid sports car produced by British automobile manufacturer McLaren Automotive. Debuted at the 2012 Paris Motor Show, sales of the P1 began in the United Kingdom in October 2013 and all 375 units were sold out by November. Production ended in early December 2015. The United States accounted for 34% of the units and Europe for 26%.</p>
<p>It is considered by the automotive press to be the successor to the McLaren F1, utilising hybrid power and Formula One technology, but does not have the same three-seat layout. It was later confirmed that the Speedtail served as the actual successor to the McLaren F1. The P1 has a mid-engine, rear wheel drive design that used a carbon fibre monocoque and roof structure safety cage concept called MonoCage, which is a development of the MonoCell first used in the MP4-12C and then in subsequent models. Its main competitors are the LaFerrari and the 918 Spyder. They are all similar in specifications and performance, and in a race around Silverstone circuit they were all within half a second of each other, the P1 finishing first at 58.24 seconds and the LaFerrari finishing last at 58.58 seconds; the 918 was in-between with 58.46 seconds.</p>
<h2>Lamborghini Sian</h2>

<p>The Sián FKP 37 is the first super sports car powered by a V12 engine and hybrid technology based on supercapacitors. Its powerful V12 engine, coupled with electric boost, creates an unrivaled gem of engineering and technology. Sián—lightning in Bolognese—is a name that captures the car’s true character, foremost its speed, which exceeds 220 mph (350 km/h).</p>
<p>With the Sián FKP 37, a new autonomous technology is entering the automotive world. At the back of the engine hood are autonomous vent flaps actuated by smart materials that are temperature sensitive by nature. These flaps open independently when the temperature around the exhausts becomes too extreme, without the aid of electric controls and sensors, relying only on the thermal distortion of the material. With its carbon-fiber monocoque, titanium intake valves, active aerodynamics and rear-wheel steering, the Sián FKP 37 employs cutting-edge technology everywhere—not only in the world’s first supercapacitor hybrid system. </p>

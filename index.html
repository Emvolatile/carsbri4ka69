<h1>The Car</h1>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/FardierdeCugnot20050111.jpg">
<p>A car is a wheeled motor vehicle that is used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people instead of goods.</p>
<p>The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.Cars became widely available during the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts.In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy.</p>
<p>Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fuelled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025.The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>

<p>The first working steam-powered vehicle was designed—and quite possibly built—by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish member of a Jesuit mission in China around 1672. It was a 65-centimetre-long (26 in) scale-model toy for the Kangxi Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger.[13][26][27] It is not known with certainty if Verbiest's model was successfully built or run.[27]

<p>Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle or car in about 1769; he created a steam-powered tricycle.[28] He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army, one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts.[29] His inventions were, however, limited by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure.[29] In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle. It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of little practical use.</p>

<p>The development of external combustion engines is detailed as part of the history of the car but often treated separately from the development of true cars. A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century, including steam cars, steam buses, phaetons, and steam rollers. In the UK, sentiment against them led to the Locomotive Acts of 1865.</p>
<h2>Buggati Chiron</h2>\

<p>The Bugatti Chiron is a mid-engine two-seater sports car designed and developed in Germany by Bugatti Engineering GmbH and manufactured in Molsheim, France, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. The successor to the Bugatti Veyron, the Chiron was first shown at the Geneva Motor Show on 1 March 2016.The car is based on the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept car.</p>
<p>The car is named after the Monégasque driver Louis Chiron.The car shares the name with the 1999 Bugatti 18/3 Chiron concept car.</p>
<p>In January 2022, every Chiron had been sold. As of January 2022, some of these sold vehicles still need to be physically manufactured and delivered to their owners.</p>
<h2>McLaren P1</h2>

<p>The McLaren P1 is a limited-production mid-engine plug-in hybrid sports car produced by British automobile manufacturer McLaren Automotive. Debuted at the 2012 Paris Motor Show, sales of the P1 began in the United Kingdom in October 2013 and all 375 units were sold out by November. Production ended in early December 2015. The United States accounted for 34% of the units and Europe for 26%.</p>
<p>It is considered by the automotive press to be the successor to the McLaren F1, utilising hybrid power and Formula One technology, but does not have the same three-seat layout. It was later confirmed that the Speedtail served as the actual successor to the McLaren F1. The P1 has a mid-engine, rear wheel drive design that used a carbon fibre monocoque and roof structure safety cage concept called MonoCage, which is a development of the MonoCell first used in the MP4-12C and then in subsequent models. Its main competitors are the LaFerrari and the 918 Spyder. They are all similar in specifications and performance, and in a race around Silverstone circuit they were all within half a second of each other, the P1 finishing first at 58.24 seconds and the LaFerrari finishing last at 58.58 seconds; the 918 was in-between with 58.46 seconds.</p>\
<h2>Lamborghini Sian</h2>

<p>The Sián FKP 37 is the first super sports car powered by a V12 engine and hybrid technology based on supercapacitors. Its powerful V12 engine, coupled with electric boost, creates an unrivaled gem of engineering and technology. Sián—lightning in Bolognese—is a name that captures the car’s true character, foremost its speed, which exceeds 220 mph (350 km/h).</p>
<p>With the Sián FKP 37, a new autonomous technology is entering the automotive world. At the back of the engine hood are autonomous vent flaps actuated by smart materials that are temperature sensitive by nature. These flaps open independently when the temperature around the exhausts becomes too extreme, without the aid of electric controls and sensors, relying only on the thermal distortion of the material. With its carbon-fiber monocoque, titanium intake valves, active aerodynamics and rear-wheel steering, the Sián FKP 37 employs cutting-edge technology everywhere—not only in the world’s first supercapacitor hybrid system. </p>

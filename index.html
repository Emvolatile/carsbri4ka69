      <p>All Chiron models are motivated by an 8.0-liter 16-cylinder powerplant. This beast of an engine employs four turbochargers to generate a mighty 1500 horsepower and 1180 pound-feet of torque. Bugatti claims that the Chiron makes the dash from zero to 60 mph in a mere 2.3 seconds, and it has a top speed of 261 mph.</p>

      <h2>McLaren P1</h2>

      <p>The P1 features a 3.8 L; 231.8 cu in (3,799 cc) twin-turbocharged V8 engine.[15] The twin turbos boost the petrol engine at 1.4 bar (20.3 psi) to deliver 737 PS (542 kW; 727 hp) at 7,500 rpm and 531 lb⋅ft (720 N⋅m) of torque at 4,000 rpm, combined with an in-house-developed electric motor producing 179 PS (132 kW; 177 hp) and 192 lb⋅ft (260 N⋅m) of torque. The electric motor and the petrol engine in the P1, produce a combined power output of 674 kW (903 hp; 916 PS) and 900 N⋅m (664 lb⋅ft) of torque.[16] The electric motor can be deployed manually by the driver or left in automatic mode, whereby the car's ECUs 'torque fill' the gaps in the petrol engine's output, which is considered turbo lag. This gives the powertrain an effective powerband of almost 7,000 rpm.</p>

      <p>The Sián FKP 37 is the first super sports car powered by a V12 engine and hybrid technology based on supercapacitors. Its powerful V12 engine, coupled with electric boost, creates an unrivaled gem of engineering and technology. Sián—lightning in Bolognese—is a name that captures the car’s true character, foremost its speed, which exceeds 220 mph (350 km/h).</p>
